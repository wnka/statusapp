* What is this?

A simple app for storing simple status updates.  I mainly wanted to play around with CouchDB and
CouchApps, so I wrote something you could easily interact with from the command line and dump status
updates into.

This is just for my goofing around with CouchDB.  If you want to use any of the code for some
strange reason, go ahead.  It's public domain.
